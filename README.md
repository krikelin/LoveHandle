LoveHandle
==========

Got a crazy idea this morning after a long sleepless night.

I'm seeking a girlfriend who loves coding and swimming like me, and as I'm a such one who have no experience of dating or so,
I created this project called "LoveHandle".

Find me on Facebook http://www.facebook.com/alexander.forselius


In case of relationship
=========
And you send a date request by forking this project (Copy my lovehandle to your account). If we be together, modify the xml file called LoveRequest with your name,
and make a pull request, which will indicate that we are together
